Client: http://georgy-clp-app.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/client

Dashboard: http://georgy-clp-app.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dashboard

(the bundle is quite large for dashboard, might need to wait a little while it loads if the network is slow)


## To run locally:

For client: 
- go to client folder
- npm install 
- npm start

For server: 
- go to server folder
- npm install 
- npm start

PS: when running locally make sure to update the graphql endpoints on the client and the CORS config on the server.
